# Ethpm-Go

This is a repository complete with utilities for creating an ethpm compliant package manager. The best way to think about this is a house for a lock file that can be validated as a correct format. Possible other packages that could be housed in the future include Swarm and IPFS utilities for interacting from the Lockfile.

# Warning

The project is in early days. There be dragonz here.
